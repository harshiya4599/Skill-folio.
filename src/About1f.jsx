                <p>
                    My name is <span className="names">Gagguturu Harshiya</span>, and I am a third-year B.tech Computer Science and Engineering student at Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering (SVCE), a NAAC++ accredited institution. I am highly passionate about continuous learning, problem-solving, and exploring emerging technologies. Through my academic journey, I have developed strong skills in Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, along with a solid understanding of modern web development practices. I actively participate in workshops such as AWS and Smart World Vision, which provide valuable knowledge and hands-on experience, helping me grow both intellectually and creatively. I believe that education is not just about gradesâ€”it is about curiosity, innovation, and building a meaningful future with purpose, dedication, and effective problem-solving skills. In my free time, I enjoy reading tech blogs, coding small projects, playing chess, and exploring new ideas in technology and design.
